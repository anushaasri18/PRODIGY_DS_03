The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in machine learning, and using a decision tree classifier to predict the species of an iris flower based on its measurements provides valuable insights into how different features contribute to classification.
Model Accuracy:
The decision tree classifier usually performs very well on the Iris dataset due to its simplicity and well-defined feature boundaries. You would generally expect high accuracy, often close to 100%, because the dataset is well-separated by the features.
Feature Importance:
The decision tree will identify which features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) are most important for distinguishing between the three species of iris. For example, petal length and petal width are often more significant predictors compared to sepal length and width.
Decision Boundaries:
The decision tree model provides an intuitive visualization of how the decision boundaries are formed based on feature values. It helps in understanding which feature ranges are associated with each species.
Overfitting:
Since the dataset is small and relatively simple, a decision tree might overfit if it's allowed to grow too deep. Pruning techniques or setting a maximum depth can help generalize better.
Classification Report:
The confusion matrix and classification report will show how well the model distinguishes between the three species (setosa, versicolor, virginica). It will provide metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.
VISUALISATION:
The decision tree plot helps visualize how decisions are made based on feature values. Each split in the tree corresponds to a decision rule based on a feature, which helps in understanding how different feature combinations lead to classification decisions.
The Iris dataset serves as a great example of how decision trees can effectively classify data with clear feature boundaries. The model's performance will likely be excellent, showcasing the effectiveness of decision trees for classification tasks with well-defined and separable classes.
